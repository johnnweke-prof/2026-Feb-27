# The Throne of Grace

#### Bible Study Plan - Friday Feb 27, 2026




---
### What is the Throne of Grace? 
---
The Throne of Grace is God's mercy seat.

Hebrews 4: 11-16 (KJV, TPT, AMPC)
Come Boldly to the Throne of Grace

---
### **Question:** Why does God ask us to come boldly? 
---

What does he say about obtaining mercy? 

What does he say about obtaining grace?

When you become a child of God, by accepting Jesus as your Savior and LORD, you can come to his throne. He wants you to function as a King in his realm. (Rev 1: 5-6)

You are sons and daughters, Heirs of God, and Joint Heirs with Christ (Romans 8:11-17)

>You are not a beggar begging God to have mercy on you. Mercy has been made available. You are a child of God coming to collect what God has freely made available for you, as a result of the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ.

It was made available when Jesus died on the cross (Colossians 1: 19, 2: 8-11; Philippians 2:11)

### Question: How do we access this throne of Grace? 
---

1. **Through prayer.** 
   Once you set your mind to talk to the Lord, and start communning with him, he is listening to you. Think of your smart phone. You say "Hey Siri" and all of a sudden the phone is ready to listen. How much more the King of Kings, the maker of the Universe? He is always there, always ready to talk with you. He engages with you as if you were the only person in the world that existed. He loves you that much.


2. **Through Words.** 
   When you pray, use words. The Lord Jesus was a master of words. His prayers were said out loud and recorded so we could read them today (John 17, The actual Lord's Prayer). So when you pray, use words, and speak out Loud - don't pray in your mind. 
   
  > Words are the bridge between the Spiritual realm and the Physical realm. Everywhere there was a move of God in the scriptures, you would always find the element of Words. Learn how to use words rightly, especially as a King/Queen in the Court of God.


3. **Through Acceptance.** 
   Once God has given the verdict, don't go back to try to change it unless you want it changed. What does that mean? If God says you are forgiven, then you are! If He says you are righteous, then accept it! 
   
   Most of the time, some people take the attitude of *"I wanna get myself right and ready before I go to God."* But here's the thing: **You can never make yourself clean enough for God, by yourself.** None of your works would qualify. Only the sacrifice of Jesus Christ fulfilled the requirement for the atonement for sin for all mankind - past, present and future. You don't have to TRY to get yourself to be GOOD for God. Instead come to him, and let him clean you up! 
   
   When you come to him, and accept him in your life, he declares you RIGHTEOUS - by giving you the righteousness of Jesus. (2 Cor 5:17). Accept it. Then you become a son/daughter of God. 
   
   Let his Word clean you up - John 15: 3 || 2 Timothy 3: 16


> *Don't fall into the trap of trying to make yourself righteous/good BEFORE coming to God.* Its a trap designed to keep people in bondage, don't fall for the scam. Run to God, with all the dirt. Let him clean you up. And don't stay there - Live for Jesus!

### Conclusion
---

Understand that your body IS the Temple of God. 

What does that mean?  

> In a Temple, worship is offered. How do you offer worship to God today?

You offer worship to God today with: 

a. **Your words** - singing praise and talking about God's greatness. (Ephesians 5: 18-22 || Psalms 150: 1)
b. **Your life and how you live it** (Romans 12: 1-2 AMPC  ||  Hebrews 12: 1-2)

c. **The fruits of your labor** (Malachi 3: 8-10 || Proverbs 3: 9-10 || Philippians 4: 14-18)

d. **Telling others about The Lord Jesus Christ** (Matthew 28: 18-20 || Mark 16: 15-18)


> In Conclusion - Come to the Lord for everything. Find grace to help for your life, your job, your thoughts, your habits, your family/significant other, your future plans, for everything. Obtain mercy. And Live for Jesus. Let your body and your lifestyle reflect the Temple of God that you are.
